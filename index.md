### CPSC 120

* Lab #1

    Lab 1, was my favorite lab because it was the introduction to GitHub and was an easy task to do, plus there was only one part. I learned how to create a folder, access the folder, clone the git repository, edit code, compile and execute code, and push code to GitHub. 


* Lab #2

    Lab 2, part 1 was a favorite because the lab was still easy to do since it was little to code. I learned how to use integers and use order of operations in coding. I liked how I understood the format because it was no different from how we solve math equations outside of coding. 


* Lab #2

    Lab 2, part 2, was my favorite lab because I was still getting used to accessing and pushing the code. I also liked how we started using strings in coding. I learned the difference between integers and strings.
